# DynaSeq
Dynaseq (http://www.sciwhylab.org/dynaseq/) offers dictionaries of 13 DNA confromational parameters for an exhaustive set of pentamers in form of static shape which represents an average shape of the pentamer and shape ensemble which incorporates the dynamic aspect of structure to generate the DNA shape profiles.

To read more about the design and concept or to cite, refer to Andrabi M, Hutchins AP, Miranda-Saavedra D, Kono H, Nussinov R, Mizuguchi K, Ahmad S.
